# About the project

This is the first time I have opened **RStudio**, so I am feeling a bit confused. But I am *sure* that this enviroment will become more familiar during this course. I think that this course will be interesting since it seems to be a course where you learn by doing. Also, it is about two really contemporary subjects: open data and open science. What I expect to learn are at least the following things:

* Learn more about open science
* Learn more about open data
* Refresh my knowledge on statistical methods

I found out about this course from Weboodi when I was planning what courses I should take this semester. And um.. not much else to say.
